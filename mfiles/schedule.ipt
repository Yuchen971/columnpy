# start time     -- the time and date that the experiment starts
# end time       -- the time and data that the experiment finishes
# water level    -- unit cm, means the distance from the soil surface to the water level, if unrestricted, specify as 0. if it is negative value, it is a snapshot of the  
# Heat intensity -- unit w/m2, means the heat from the infrade lamp
# soil type      -- 1,2,3 means the type of the soil applied.
# output         -- if =1 the result will only be output for 60mm column, if=2 will output only for 90mm column, if =3 output for both, if =0 the result will not be output 
# scale no       -- specify which column in scale.dat does this schedule refers
